World famous astrologer Lolita needs a Horoscope-as-a-Service (HaaS) application, because she is tired of doing all these complex astrological calculations by hand. 

Using Laravel and SQL database of your choice, create an application that: 
- generates horoscopes for all 12 Zodiac signs for a given year. Each sign can have from 1 (really shitty day) to 10 (super amazing day). Day scores are generated randomly for each day and stored in the database. 
- shows a calendar for a given year and Zodiac sign. Days should be colored from #ff0000 (really shitty) to #00ff00 (super amazing). 
- shows the best month on average (by score) for a Zodiac sign in a given year. 
- shows which Zodiac sign has the best year (by score) 

BONUS POINTS: generate a sentence that describes what happens to an astrological sign on a given day. Sentence should be relevant to the score of the day (1 - 10) and not be repetitive.
